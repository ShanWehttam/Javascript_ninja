//Destructuring an array or a string gives an index of each element
  {...[1,2,3]} {..."1,2,3"}
//parsefloat instead of parseInt because they're both stricter than Number.  Number() allows strings
  parseInt("564367457868423.00")
//break and continue can only be used within for loop statements.  I shouldn't need these when i have .filter
//return stops the function there and then
//paralell assignment to an expression that returns an array
  [one, two] = [<array of some sort>]
//An iterable is a type of Object that can have a 'for of' loop used on it.  Strings and Arrays are Iterables.  Not Objects
//Strict mode stops us from declaring a variable without const or let
  "use strict"
